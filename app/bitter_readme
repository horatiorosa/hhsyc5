Typography

All type is based on $base-font-size which is set to 1em (16px) by default. The spacing around type is based on $base-line-height so as to keep a semi-baseline grid. All sizes are scaled up or down by a factor of 0.25.

Lists

All lists have stripped out styles. No bullets, no left padding. To add back the expected browser default styles add @extend %default-ul; or @extend %default-ol; to the <ul> or <ol> respectively.

Forms

Adds basic styles all form elements. The variables at the top of the file all inherit from the variables file but make it really easy to be overridden.

Buttons

Basic style for button and input[type="submit"]. Base button styles can be changed by modifying the styles applied to button and #{$all-button-inputs} in base/_button.scss.
