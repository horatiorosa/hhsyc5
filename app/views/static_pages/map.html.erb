	          			As we journey through life we are constantly looking for the <span class="bold">“MAP to Success”</span>.  It is no secret that poor decision-making can ruin a young person’s life.  HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, Gun & Gang Violence, poverty, unemployment and dropping out of school threaten the safety and well being of our youth and young adults.  To protect our young participants from the dangers they are confronted with daily, we created a tri-level division represented by parents and professionals that will provide Direction, Leadership, & Guidance to our youths. Having a seasoned team to consult with will surely reduce the mistakes of our participants and increase their chances of success.
