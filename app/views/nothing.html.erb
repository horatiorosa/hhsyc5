          			The Mission of the Hip-Hop Summit Youth Council (“HHSYC”) is to work as an advocacy group to protect the rights, interest and future of our youths and young adults while addressing a host of issues that confront them daily.  By partnering with schools, the entertainment industry, private and government agencies we have created a unique network that provides the resources to help young people fulfill their social and academic goals.  Through the use of Hip-Hop we have bridged the communication gap between our youths and adults and have earned the trust and respect of both.     
      				</p>

		            As the Multi-Billion dollar Hip-Hop Culture grows stronger, so does the "Raptivism Movement." It represents the New Social Message behind the Hip-Hop culture.  As we grow as a company Parents, Artists, Executives, Politicians, Clergy, Businessmen and Community Leaders continue to support our work to use Hip-Hop as a tool for enlightenment and social change.  Throughout the years we have created many programs that prepare our participants for the obstacles they will face and the leadership roles they will soon encounter.
      				</p>
      				<p>
		            To improve the quality of life in our schools and communities we must create an environment that fosters respect, trust and cooperation.  As parents we must take responsibility for the failures and anti-social behavior of our youths and young adults because "It Takes an Entire Village to Raise a Child."  Through our program we will visit schools, youth centers, prisons and housing projects delivering a positive message while offering prizes, awards, grants, scholarships and other incentives that will improve the safety, academic and social development of our youths and young adults.
